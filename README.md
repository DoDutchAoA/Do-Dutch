# W4156 Go Dutch

## Second iteration

### 1. Progress overview

After the first iteration, tasks were classified into the users-related part and the receipt-related part and assigned to Qianrui and Yushi, Zhihao and Qian respectively. The progress for both parts are listed below:

- User-related part:
  [Qianrui and/or Yushi]

- Receipt-related part:
  [NJ]

### 2. Coverage report

We deployed coverage.py, a code coverage tool serves to Python program, to analyze the code coverage of our database test script. The report can be accessed by this [link](https://github.com/DoDutchAoA/Do-Dutch/blob/jenkins/tests/test-reports/coverage.xml).

### 3. Future work

By the demo day for the second iteration, the receipt team is expected to complete the development of all user stories related to the receipt. If time allows, the progress of corresponding tests should be caught up. In the demo for the second iteration, functions mentioned in all user stories should work both individually and integrally. After that, the main tasks for us would be the user testing, maintenance, and UI polishing, if time allows.

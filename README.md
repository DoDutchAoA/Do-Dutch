* Front-end 
We used React native framework for front-end. The program is written in Javascript. 
In order to precommit javascript code, we use a precommit code called Prettier (https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) 
Some of the front-end precommit histories are showed below:

* Back-end 
For back-end we used Python with Flask, and MySQL for database management. 
Some of out back-end precommit histories are showed below:
